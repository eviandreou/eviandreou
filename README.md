## Hi, I’m Evi 👋

I’m a content writer and editor focused on clarity, structure and SEO.

My work sits at the intersection of content and technical teams:
turning complex ideas into clear, usable communication and
supporting collaboration across roles.

I’m interested in content structure, documentation,
and workflows that help teams work better together.

📍 Based in Greece
